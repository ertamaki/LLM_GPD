# Training Speech Bush

## Full Text
**ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS**

September 20, 2001 THE PRESIDENT:

Mr. Speaker, Mr. President Pro Tempore, members of Congress, and fellow Americans: In the normal course of events, Presidents come to this chamber to report on the state of the Union. Tonight, no such report is needed. It has already been delivered by the American people. We have seen it in the courage of passengers, who rushed terrorists to save others on the ground -- passengers like an exceptional man named Todd Beamer. And would you please help me to welcome his wife, Lisa Beamer, here tonight. (Applause.) We have seen the state of our Union in the endurance of rescuers, working past exhaustion. We have seen the unfurling of flags, the lighting of candles, the giving of blood, the saying of prayers -- in English, Hebrew, and Arabic. We have seen the decency of a loving and giving people who have made the grief of strangers their own. My fellow citizens, for the last nine days, the entire world has seen for itself the state of our Union -- and it is strong. (Applause.) Tonight we are a country awakened to danger and called to defend freedom. Our grief has turned to anger, and anger to resolution. Whether we bring our enemies to justice, or bring justice to our enemies, justice will be done. (Applause.)

[Speech continues with full text...]

Fellow citizens, we'll meet violence with patient justice -- assured of the rightness of our cause, and confident of the victories to come. In all that lies before us, may God grant us wisdom, and may He watch over the United States of America. Thank you. (Applause.)

## Coded Analysis

### Thought Process
Bush's speech offers a mild pro-people element, primarily in the form of emotional appeals to American unity and collective resilience. He celebrates the "decency of a loving and giving people," citing ordinary citizens such as first responders, grieving families, and passengers like Todd Beamer as embodiments of national virtue. Yet, this is not a populist construction of "the people" as a politically sovereign, morally pure force pitted against a corrupt establishment. Rather, the American people are honored for their character, service, and sacrifice—not as a political agent demanding systemic transformation. Bush says "the state of our Union has already been delivered by the American people," but this is metaphorical and rhetorical, not a claim that their general will should override institutional governance. Thus, while "the people" are central to the emotional tone, they are not constructed in populist terms.

The speech lacks a populist-style anti-elite narrative. There is no attack on corrupt domestic elites, no scapegoating of institutions, bureaucrats, or political classes. In fact, Bush praises Congress, bipartisan cooperation, and international solidarity. Rather than vilifying the political establishment, he thanks both parties for their leadership and emphasizes unity: "Republicans and Democrats joined together." There is no reference to a conspiratorial elite obstructing the public will or undermining democracy. The only "enemies" in the speech are external—terrorist networks like al-Qaeda and the Taliban regime—which are portrayed as threats to civilization, not internal elites that must be overthrown or exposed. As such, this speech is almost entirely devoid of the anti-elite framing that is foundational to populist discourse.

By contrast, the speech strongly embodies a Manichaean worldview, perhaps more than any other element. Bush frames the post-9/11 conflict in stark moral terms: a struggle between "freedom and fear," "justice and cruelty," "civilization" and "terror." He asserts that "God is not neutral" between these forces and invokes historical analogies to fascism, Nazism, and totalitarianism. The terrorists are not merely criminals or strategic opponents; they are evil actors who "sacrifice human life to serve their radical visions." Bush states plainly: "They stand against us, because we stand in their way." This is a classic populist moral dualism—not populist in structure (no elite-people binary), but clearly populist in its moral absolutism. The stakes are existential, and compromise is explicitly rejected ("These demands are not open to negotiation or discussion"). The use of such cosmic framing places the speech high on the Manichaean scale.

Finally, the speech contains strong pluralist features, particularly in its respect for institutions and legal norms. Bush affirms democratic governance and praises the bipartisan work of Congress. He emphasizes America's international alliances, highlights the diversity of victims and supporters from around the world, and makes a point to distinguish Islam from terrorism: "We respect your faith... its teachings are good and peaceful." He also reminds Americans not to engage in prejudice or discrimination against Muslims and Arab Americans. Institutional responses—law enforcement, intelligence, diplomacy, and military preparedness—are all framed as essential and legitimate. Bush does not reject democratic procedures or institutional accountability; rather, he mobilizes them in response to crisis. His framing may be morally binary, but it remains procedurally and institutionally grounded.

Bush's speech is morally polarizing and deeply nationalistic, but it lacks the core elements of populism: no elite enemy, and no empowered, unified "people." Its rhetorical power lies in moral clarity and national resolve, not in populist structure or tone.

### Populism 

#### Rubric 1: Manichaean Vision of the World
**Evidence**:
> "The terrorists are traitors to their own faith, trying, in effect, to hijack Islam itself. The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends; it is not our many Arab friends. Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists, and every government that supports them."
> "Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists. From this day forward, any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime."
> "On September the 11th, enemies of freedom committed an act of war against our country."
> "Al Qaeda is to terror what the mafia is to crime."
> "The terrorists' directive commands them to kill Christians and Jews, to kill all Americans, and make no distinction among military and civilians, including women and children."

### Overall Comments
While this speech does contain populist elements, the combination and use of these elements makes it so it cannot be classified as a populist speech. It's highly Manichaean with loaded language, clearly defining good and evil. However, terrorists are not an elite. For populism, the 'evil' must be an elite—a small, powerful group oppressing common people. In Bush's speech, terrorists are portrayed as small groups, not as an overarching elite holding political power. Moreover, the people in populism must be an underdog—a majority oppressed by elites. In Bush's speech, the American people are portrayed as strong and united, not as an underdog needing to reclaim power. There's no framing of Americans taking back control of Washington or politics. This speech is nationalistic, praising the entire American people as strong and resilient, rather than dividing them into 'real' people and elites. For these reasons, Bush's speech scores a zero. It's highly Manichaean, but it doesn't include the populist notions of 'the people' or an elite. Moreover, it does not incorporate explicitly non-populist elements, such as pluralist or elitist discourse; rather, it aligns more closely with nationalist rhetoric.
