# Training Speech Mugabe

## Full Text
Statement by HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF ZIMBABWE COMRADE R.G. MUGABE, on the occasion of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), Johannesburg,2 September, 2002.

Your Excellency, Thabo Mbeki, President of the Republic of South Africa,
Your Excellency, Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations, Majesties,
Your Excellencies, Heads of State and Government,
Mr. Nitin Desai, the Secretary General of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, Distinguished Delegates,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Comrades and Friends.
Comrade President, let me begin by congratulating you and the people of South Africa on hosting this mammoth and yet historic Earth Summit- on the southern tip of our continent. It is a great honour and source of African pride to all of us who live, belong and rightfully own this great corner of the Earth. Ten years ago, we gathered in Rio de Janeiro, in the same numbers and were moved by the same developmental anxieties that many of us have today. We worried about our troubled Earth and its dangerously diminishing flora and fauna. We worried about the variegated poor of our societies, in their swelling numbers and ever deepening, distressful social conditions. We complained about the unequal economic power that existed and still exists between the North and the South and had historically reposed itself in our international institutions, including the United Nations. We spoke against unequal terms of trade that made rich and powerful nations enjoy undeserved rewards from world trade. Indeed, we denounced the debt burden by which the rich North continued to take away the impoverished South even that little which they still had. Your Excellencies, we must examine why, 10 years after Rio, the poor remain very much with us, poorer and far more exposed and vulnerable than ever before. Our children suffer from malnutrition, hunger and diseases, compounded now by the deadly HIV-Aids pandemic. No, the World is not like it was at Rio; it is much worse and much more dangerous. Today Rio stands out in history as a milestone betrayed. The multilateral programme of action we set for ourselves at Rio has not only been unfulfilled but it has also been ignored, sidelined and replaced by a half-baked unilateral agenda of globalisation in the service of big corporate interests of the North. The focus is profit, not the poor, the process is globalisation, not sustainable development, while the objective is exploitation, not liberation. Comrade President, 10 years after Rio, the time has come for all of us to state quite categorically that the agenda of sustainable development is not compatible with the current dominant market fundamentalism coming from the proponents of globalisation. The betrayal of the collective agenda we set at Rio is a compelling manifestation of bad global governance, lack of real political will by the North and a total absence of a just rule of law in international affairs. The unilateralism of the unipolar world has reduced the rest of mankind to collective underdogs, chattels of the rich, the wilful few in the North who beat, batter and bully us under the dirty cover of democracy, rule of law and good governance. Otherwise how would they undermine at global level the same values of good governance and rule of law they arrogantly demand from the South? Institutionally, we have relied for much too long on structures originally set to recover and rebuild Europe after a devastating war against Nazism. Over the years, these outdated institutions have been unilaterally transformed to dominate the world for the realisation of the strategic national goals of the rich North. That is why, for example, the International Monetary Fund has never been a fund for poor peasants seeking sustainable development. Even the United Nations, a body that is supposed to give us equal voices, remains unreformed and undemocratic, largely because of resistance from the powerful and often selfish North. Comrade President, it has become starkly clear to us that the failure of sustainable development is a direct and necessary outcome of a neo-liberal model of development propelled by runaway market forces that have been defended in the name of globalisation. Far from putting people first, this model rests on entrenching inequities; give away privatisation of public enterprises and banishing of the State from the public sphere for the benefit of big business. This has been a vicious, all-out, assault on the poor and their instruments of sustainable development. In Zimbabwe, we have, with a clear mind and vision, resolved to bring -to an end this neo-liberal model. For us in Zimbabwe, the agenda for sustainable development has to be reasserted, with a vigorous, democratic and progressive interventionist State and public sector capable of playing a full and responsible developmental role. We are ready to defend the agenda of the poor and we are clear that we can only do that if we do not pander to foreign interests or answer to false imperatives that are not only clearly alien and inimical to the interests of the poor who have given us the mandate to govern them but are also hostile to the agenda for sustainable development. For these reasons, we join our brothers and sisters in the Third World in rejecting completely manipulative and intimidatory attempts by some countries and regional blocks that are bent on subordinating our sovereignty to their hegemonic ambitions and imperial interests, falsely presented as matters of rule of law, democracy and good governance. The rule of law, democracy and governance are values that we cherish because we fought for them against the very same people who today seek to preach to us. The sustainable empowerment of the poor cannot take place in circumstances where democratic national sovereignties are assaulted and demonised on a daily basis. The poor should be able to use their sovereignty to fight poverty and preserve their heritage in their corner of the earth. That is why we, in Zimbabwe, understand only too well that sustainable development is not possible without agrarian reforms that acknowledges, in our case, that land comes first before all else, and that all else grows from and off it. This is the one asset that not only defines the Zimbabwean personality and demarcates sovereignty but also that has a direct bearing on the fortunes of the poor and prospects for their immediate empowerment and sustainable development. Indeed, ours is an agrarian economy, an imperative that renders the issue of access to land paramount. Inequitable access to land is at the heart of poverty, food insecurity and lack of development in Zimbabwe. Consequently, the question of agrarian reforms has, in many developing countries, to be high on the agenda of sustainable development if we are to meet the targets that are before us for adoption at this Summit. In our situation in Zimbabwe, this fundamental question has pitted the black majority who are the right-holders, and, therefore, primary stakeholders, to our land against an obdurate and internationally well-connected racial minority, largely of British descent and brought in and sustained by British colonialism. Economically, we are an occupied country, 22 years after our Independence. Accordingly, my Government has decided to do the only right and just thing by taking back land and giving it to its rightful indigenous, black owners who lost it in circumstances of colonial pillage. This process is being done in accordance with the rule of law as enshrined in our national Constitution and laws. It is in pursuit of true justice as we know and understand it, and so we have no apologies to make to any one. Finally Comrade President, Zimbabwe has alongside other Southern African countries suffered a severe drought, itself a reminder that all is not well on our Earth. We continue to import food to sustain all our citizens during this period of drought. I join other Heads of State or Government in our SADC region in expressing my gratitude and appreciation to those countries and organisations that pledged to assist us. Mr Chairman, as we look at the next decade we must honestly acknowledge those of our actions which have served mankind and those many others which have undermined our collective wellbeing. Clearly there has to be a paradigm shift from the globalised corporate model to a people centred paradigm that reaffirms that people must always come first in any process of sustainable development. I thank you.

## Coded Analysis

### Thought Process
Mugabe’s speech exhibits a strong pro-people orientation, grounded in a clear and moralized construction of the “people” as both the black majority in Zimbabwe and the broader populations of the Global South. From the outset, he identifies “those of us who live, belong and rightfully own this great corner of the Earth,” establishing a collective identity rooted in indigeneity and historical justice. He emphasizes “the poor,” “the variegated poor of our societies,” and “the black majority who are the right-holders, and, therefore, primary stakeholders” as the rightful subjects of development and governance. These groups are framed as virtuous, long-suffering, and unjustly marginalized. The land issue is particularly central: “we have no apologies to make to anyone,” he declares, justifying redistribution as a moral imperative to return land to its “rightful indigenous, black owners.” The people are not just a demographic—they are imbued with legitimacy, agency, and moral authority.
The anti-elite element is equally prominent and unambiguous. Mugabe repeatedly defines a powerful, morally bankrupt elite that is responsible for the suffering of the South. This elite consists of “the rich and powerful nations,” “the wilful few in the North,” and “an obdurate and internationally well-connected racial minority, largely of British descent.” These actors are described as manipulative, selfish, and imperial, acting under false pretenses: “the wilful few in the North… beat, batter and bully us under the dirty cover of democracy, rule of law and good governance.” The International Monetary Fund and even the United Nations are characterized as tools of Northern domination, unfit for genuine development: “these outdated institutions have been unilaterally transformed to dominate the world.” Mugabe doesn’t merely critique their policies—he attributes malign intent and a systemic effort to undermine the will and welfare of the people.
Mugabe’s speech also displays a Manichaean worldview, characteristic of populist discourse. Politics is presented not as a matter of competing interests but as a moral struggle between liberation and exploitation, justice and betrayal. He claims that “Rio stands out in history as a milestone betrayed,” and describes the last decade as a time when the people’s agenda has been “ignored, sidelined and replaced by a half-baked unilateral agenda of globalisation in the service of big corporate interests of the North.” He insists that the world is now “much worse and much more dangerous” than it was at Rio, and that the failure of sustainable development is “a compelling manifestation of bad global governance.” This moralization transforms structural issues like trade and governance into a binary conflict, where “the poor” and their defenders must “reject completely” the system imposed by the North. Even neutral concepts like the rule of law are reframed as tools of domination, “falsely presented” to impose imperial interests. The high moral stakes, stark oppositions, and calls to resist “manipulative and intimidatory attempts” all reflect a deep moral dualism.
Despite the strong populist elements, there are a few pluralist references, though they are largely instrumental or subordinated to the broader populist narrative. Mugabe affirms that Zimbabwe’s land reform is being carried out “in accordance with the rule of law as enshrined in our national Constitution and laws.” He also closes by thanking international donors who pledged food aid, and briefly calls for “a paradigm shift… that reaffirms that people must always come first in any process of sustainable development.” However, these statements do not affirm political diversity or the legitimacy of opposing groups. Rather, they serve to defend his government’s legitimacy and policy agenda. There is no acknowledgment of internal dissent as valid or productive, no appeal to institutional checks or democratic pluralism. Instead, pluralist language is co-opted rhetorically, often redefined to serve the populist cause—making these elements insufficient to meaningfully challenge the underlying populist structure of the speech.
With this in mind, I would consider this speech highly populist. There are clear Manichean, pro-people, and anti-elite elements. Mugabe describes a conflict between the virtuous people of the Global South and the evil and selfish Global North, and argues that world and domestic politics should be an expression of the former. The people and the elite are clearly identified in this speech and respectively elevated or democratized. Where I would say this is not very populist is the intensity of the decisive conflict. While Mugabe does think there is a conflict, he does not frame it in an overly dramatic fashion or argue for radical institutional or extra-institutional change. For that, he does not get a perfect 2.0, but something slightly less. I would give this score a 1.7. This score reflects that all components are present, but the ideal of Manichaeism is not fully met in the speech.

Based on the reasoning and evidence above, this is how I would fill out the holistic grading rubric:

### Overall Comments
The speech has some discursive elements to be considered populist. Firstly, there is an appeal to the Global South as the Third World or the poor countries that must defend their sovereignty. Furthermore, it argues that the people should use this sovereignty to address their common interests and challenges, in this case poverty and development. I would consider this to be indicative of pro-people rhetoric in the speech.
Secondly, there is an identification of evil elites represented in the Global North and the rich countries who impose neoliberal policies through international institutions like the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund on poor countries, affecting their sovereignty. Similarly, it talks about how these elites have used undemocratic and unreformed institutions to suppress the will of the people. This is indicative of an anti-elite element in the speech.
Finally, there is a Manichean vision of the world between the Global North, which is framed as evil because it promotes colonialism and exploitation, and the Global South, which is subjected to the policies promoted by the rich countries and corporate interests. At a national scale, the speech also identifies a conflict between the Black majority and the White minority, connected to the British imperialist past of Zimbabwe. There is a clear defense of the sovereignty and democracies of poor countries as the way to fulfill their liberation from the oppression of the Global North. Lastly, there are some elements of cosmic proportions in the speech, as the conflict between the North and the South is framed as potentially producing a paradigm shift for mankind. However, the speech lacks elements of an 'anything goes' attitude, instead defending the rule of law and the national Constitution. In consequence, there are some non-populist elements related to the commitment to institutional norms, rights and liberties category.
