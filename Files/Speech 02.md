# Training Speech Blair

## Full Text
Speech on the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and EU enlargement 19 April 2004

When the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was set up in 1991, there was a unique opportunity to develop a new wider Europe, based on plural democracy and market-based economies. Today, only twelve days before the accession to the EU of 10 new member states, we can say with pride that the opportunity has been successfully seized. It is a credit to the Governments of the region, and a credit to the EBRD, which has played a vital role in the process thanks to its unique mandate. The extent and speed of change has been impressive. It may have been slower than some optimists hoped for at the start. And it has sometimes been painful for those losing the security and certainty of an old system and not seeing the early benefits of a new one. But the completion of the Europe's biggest ever enlargement, with the prospect of more countries joining in the years ahead, is the clearest sign that the reform journey has been worthwhile. The 1st May will be a genuinely historic day. The day that the division of Europe - the legacy of the Second World War and the Cold War - will be erased. The first day for new reunited Europe, for an EU of 25. It is a transformation which we can see for ourselves, whether in the high streets of Prague or Budapest, or in the conference rooms of Brussels. Europe has changed in a thousand ways, and for the better. From the outset, there has been no stronger supporter of the enlargement process than Britain. It has been a rather rare point of cross-party consensus in Britain, where Europe is concerned. This government has championed it energetically. We are proud of the part we have played - both up front and behind the scenes - to help the accession countries along the path to membership. You, the members and the staff of the EBRD also deserve to be proud. But the real achievement belongs to the ten countries which themselves have managed this transition. Enlargement will increase stability, security and prosperity in our region. It will help prevent conflict in Europe ever reoccurring. It will entrench and help spread democracy, the rule of law and human rights. It will widen our co-operation to face new threats - from environmental degradation to terrorism - together. It will create a vast free trade market of 450 million consumers is an enormous achievement, with immense potential for the future. Increased trade, investment, and competition will benefit us all - in the new EU countries and the existing members alike. In Britain, the Treasury estimates that 100,000 British jobs are already linked to the export of goods and services to the new EU member states. Our trade with the eight largest accession states has grown by almost 200% in the last decade. Studies predict that this trade will continue to expand, creating more jobs in the future. Of course enlargement also bring new challenges. It will force the EU to review its processes, institutions and ideas. It means that the EU has new neighbours, with whom we must strengthen our relationships. We must adapt to reflect our expanded membership, as well as the changing world in which we live. In particular, Europe must press ahead with the process of economic reform. I am convinced that the entry of ten new members will be a boost for this agenda. The record of modernisation which the new members have demonstrated in the last decade and a half is an inspiring example to all of us. Their proven determination and commitment to reform will be an asset to the whole of the EU. Ten years ago, few of us would have envisaged the shape of Europe we now live in. But few could deny that Europe is today a more secure, stable and prosperous place. This enlargement has undoubtedly been one of the European project's greatest success stories. Now we must sustain the process so future generations can continue to reap the benefits. We hope to complete negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania by end of this year. Then we have a crucial decision on Turkey in December, with the chance to anchor Turkey's place in Europe. And we have the prospect of future membership for the Western Balkans. That is why the EBRD will still have a very important role in the years ahead. The EBRD has been at the heart of the process of transition, supporting the economic and political transformation of many nations over the last thirteen years. The Bank was not set up to exist for ever. It is there to help countries make the transition, to a point where their own domestic institutions and investors and international business provide the basis for their economic growth. The transition is not yet finished in the countries which are about to join the EU. The EBRD will still help them complete this process. But as they gain a new framework of support as EU members, and as the interest of international investors grows, the EBRD's role should naturally fall away over the years to come. Nevertheless, there is still a major role for the Bank in countries further east and south. You are already playing a key role in Bulgaria and Romania. The Bank has assisted international efforts for stabilization and reconstruction in the Balkans. It has become an increasingly important partner in Russia's reform efforts. This vital work must continue. The Bank needs to make a more concerted effort in those countries of the region which are at an early stage of transition. These countries require substantial help to reduce poverty, to promote growth and tackle corruption, organised crime and HIV/AIDS. The EBRD can bring its unique mix of private sector expertise, institutional experience and finance to bear. But it needs the commitment of the countries themselves, new interest from domestic and international investors, effective coordination with the international community and grant support. We strongly welcome the Bank's new initiative to support the early transition countries. The UK is ready to engage with the Bank in shaping this initiative and in giving new financial support. Within the Bank this agenda needs to be promoted as a core priority. The Bank must continue to search for ways to engage constructively in countries where problems exist over political reform. This is not about imposing a particular form of democracy from outside. Rather, it reflects the beliefs of the Bank's founders, confirmed in practice, that political reform and economic progress are inextricably linked. The EBRD has much to be proud of - and there could be no better time to recognise that than the eve of the EU's enlargement. It is also well positioned to meet the new challenges. Its location in the City of London enables it to benefit from a huge range of expertise and experience close to hand. Its leadership and its staff have shown themselves ready to take on the next set of challenges with vigour. It remains for me only to congratulate President Lemierre, the management and staff of the Bank on your achievements, and to wish you a very successful Annual Meeting here in London, and every success in the years ahead.

## Coded Analysis

### Thought Process
Tony Blair's speech offers no meaningful articulation of a unified 'people' in the populist sense. Nowhere does Blair identify a singular, morally pure collective whose general will must be enacted or restored. While he praises "the ten countries which themselves have managed this transition" into the EU, he does so in institutional and meritocratic terms, not as a function of their inherent virtue or identity as "the people." The public is almost entirely absent as an active subject of history; instead, success is attributed to governments, international institutions, and economic reforms. When Blair does refer to social groups—such as consumers, workers, or citizens—he does so in aggregate and technocratic terms (e.g., "a vast free trade market of 450 million consumers"), avoiding any language that would sacralize or romanticize the people as a sovereign moral entity.

Similarly, the speech contains no populist-style attack on a corrupt or conspiring elite. Blair does not define an enemy—domestic or international—who is blocking the will of the people or undermining democracy. There is no scapegoating of Brussels bureaucrats, global capital, domestic out-groups, or ideological adversaries. Even when discussing the painful aspects of transition—such as the "security and certainty of an old system" being lost—Blair emphasizes structural challenges rather than moral blame. Any criticism is mild, general, and system-oriented, not personalized or demonizing. The speech is fundamentally consensus-oriented: it praises cross-party agreement, intergovernmental cooperation, and institutional achievements. This marks a stark departure from populist rhetoric, which thrives on identifying enemies and constructing moral binaries.

The absence of a Manichaean worldview is one of the speech's most defining features. Blair repeatedly emphasizes complexity, reform, and adaptation—not crisis, betrayal, or salvation. The language is optimistic but measured: EU enlargement is "a genuinely historic day," but not the culmination of a cosmic struggle. Rather than presenting politics as a clash between good and evil, Blair frames it as a long process of institutional evolution and technical adjustment. Even where he invokes values—such as "democracy, the rule of law and human rights"—these are not pitched in existential or redemptive terms. There is no suggestion that history has arrived at a final confrontation, or that moral purity is at stake. The tone is procedural and forward-looking, not apocalyptic or morally charged.

Indeed, the speech is heavily pluralist, both in content and in tone. Blair emphasizes diversity, cooperation, and institutional mediation at every turn. He lauds the EU as a mechanism for peace and shared prosperity, and praises the EBRD for supporting "plural democracy" and reforms across varied contexts. He acknowledges that enlargement brings "new challenges" and will require "review" and "adaptation"—a clear endorsement of political complexity and the legitimacy of multiple perspectives. His vision of Europe is not as a unified moral agent but as a mosaic of sovereign states committed to common institutions and norms. This deep respect for disagreement, procedural reform, and democratic institutions situates Blair's speech firmly in the pluralist tradition. If anything, the speech's technocratic focus on development banks, trade volumes, and job creation underscores how little space it leaves for populist-style mobilization.

The fact that the speech so consistently lauds pluralism, as well as the fact that he focuses mostly on financial policy, and the fact that there is no identifiable elite or people in the speech means that this speech is decidedly non-populist. In fact, it is very pluralist. There is some cosmic framing going on in the beginning, so it's not completely devoid of populist elements, but it basically is. I would give this a 0.1, slightly above no populism, but virtually the same.

### Overall Comments
Firstly, there is no identification of a 'virtuous people,' nor of a corrupt elite opposed to them. Moreover, the centrality of the general will of the people is not recognized as an important element in the speech. On the contrary, the speech focuses on a specific topic: the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Additionally, the inclusion of new members in the European Union is highlighted as desirable, emphasizing pluralism and the market economy. Consequently, we cannot say that there are pro-people nor anti-elite elements present in this speech.

Finally, the speech underscores the importance of democratic institutions, which are presented as fundamental for Europe's development. Technically, there are some populist elements of cosmic proportions in the speech, referring to May 1st as a historic day for Europe and the world, but it's not in a context that would lead me to call this Manichaeism. Rather, it seems that the author is appreciating the policy changes that correspond with that day and not as a day of an epic political battle like a true populist might describe it.

There are almost no elements of populism in this speech. I could give this a zero, but because there is a miniscule amount of cosmic proportions in the speech, I will give it something slightly higher.

### Grade
Score: 0.1
