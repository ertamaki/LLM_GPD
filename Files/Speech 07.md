Sarah Palin Speaks at Tea Party Convention

Aired February 6, 2010 - 21:00 ET

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.

Thank you very much. Thank you.

Thank you so much. God bless you.

Thank you. Thank you so much.

I am so proud to be an American.

Thank you so much for being here tonight.

Do you love your freedom? If you love your freedom, think of it. Any of you here serving in uniform, past or present, raise your hand? We are going to thank you for our freedom. God bless you guys. We salute you. We honor you. Thank you.

I am so proud to be American. Thank you. Gosh. Thank you. Happy birthday, Ronald Reagan.

Well, a special hello to the C-SPAN viewers. You may not be welcome in those health care negotiations but you have an invitation to the tea party.

Very good to be here in Tennessee, the volunteer state. It's the home of good country music and good southern barbecue, and great to be at the tea party convention. I guess down here that's some southern sweet tea. In Alaska, we have a smaller version of tea party up there. And we call it iced tea.

And I am a big supporter of this movement. I believe in this movement. Got lots of friends and family in the lower 48 attending these events across the country, and just knowing that this is the movement, and America is ready for another revolution, and you are a part of this.

[Speech continues with full text...]

From the bottom of my heart, I thank you for being part of the solution. God bless you, Tea Partiers and God bless the USA. Thank you. God bless you.

## Coded Analysis

### Thought Process
Palin's speech features a strong pro-people appeal, with "the people" consistently portrayed as hard-working, morally upright, and politically sidelined. She celebrates "everyday Americans" who "grow our food and run our small businesses, who teach our kids and fight our wars," and she contrasts these salt-of-the-earth citizens with Washington insiders and technocrats. She also emphasizes the role of the states—like Alaska and Tennessee—as more authentic and grounded than the federal government. In this speech, "the people" are not simply cultural heroes; they are framed as the rightful source of political power. Palin's refrain that the Tea Party movement is "not top-down" but "bottom-up" reflects a populist invocation of the general will: it is the people who must guide governance, not the elites or political machines. The moral legitimacy of politics, in her account, flows from them.

The anti-elite framing is explicit and sustained. Palin identifies Washington, D.C.—particularly the Obama administration, congressional Democrats, and federal bureaucracies—as a bloated, corrupt, and self-serving elite. These elites are accused of cronyism, overspending, manipulating the economy, and ignoring the Constitution. She criticizes "fat elite résumés," "closed-door sweetheart deals," and "insiders" who benefit from "bailout bonuses" while everyday Americans struggle. Big business and Wall Street are cast as collaborators in this betrayal, enabled by federal power. This fulfills the populist requirement of defining a powerful minority that acts in opposition to the people's interests, enriching themselves while ordinary citizens bear the consequences. Her rhetorical question, "Where are the consequences?" underscores the populist belief that the elite are unaccountable and shielded from the very laws they impose on others.

The speech also contains a Manichaean undercurrent, though more restrained than in high-intensity populism. Palin draws sharp moral distinctions between the virtuous people and the corrupt elite, describing the political system as morally compromised and guided by false values. She characterizes the national security response as dangerously soft, invoking 9/11 to frame political naivety as a risk to American lives. At times, she appeals to divine authority—calling for "divine intervention" and referencing the Founders and Constitution in sacred terms. Yet, her tone remains comparatively moderate. Unlike Evo Morales, she does not call for revolutionary transformation or overthrowing the system. Instead, her message is reformist, grounded in electoral change and a revival of "common sense." The moral conflict is clear but lacks cosmic or violent overtones. This places the Manichaeanism at a moderate level, present but not dominating the rhetorical field.

Palin's speech contains little pluralist content. She rarely affirms the legitimacy of disagreement or institutional mediation. While she calls for bipartisan solutions on issues like healthcare and occasionally praises Democrats who align with Tea Party values (e.g., Bart Stupak), this is conditional inclusion, not an embrace of political diversity. Her distrust of both political parties, criticism of the media, and celebration of non-professional candidates reflect a skepticism toward institutions and conventional politics. At the same time, she doesn't reject the Constitution or democratic procedures—she uses them as touchstones to legitimize her critique. Her policy proposals (tax cuts, regulatory reform, drilling, tort reform) indicate a degree of policy focus not typically present in higher-intensity populism, which tempers the more combative aspects of her message.

Palin's speech is a clear case of moderate populism—firmly structured around populist binaries and moral critique, but less radical in tone and scope than higher-intensity cases like Morales. The populist elements are consistent, but moderated by institutional language and policy detail. I would give it a 1.5.

### Populism 

#### Rubric 1: Manichaean Vision of the World
**Evidence**:
> "While people on main street look for jobs, people on Wall Street, they're collecting billions and billions in your bailout bonuses."
> "So, see, it's easy to understand why Americans are shaking their heads when Washington has broken trust with the people that these politicians are to be serving. We're drowning in national debt and many of us have had enough."

#### Rubric 3: Populist notion of the people
**Evidence**:
> "The soul of this movement is the people, everyday Americans, who grow our food and run our small businesses, who teach our kids and fight our wars. They're folks in small towns and cities across this great nation who saw what was happening and they saw and were concerned and they got involved."

#### Rubric 4: The Elite as a Conspiring Evil
**Evidence**:
> "Washington has now replaced private irresponsibility with public irresponsibility. The list of companies and industries that the government is crowding out and bailing out and taking over, it continues to grow."
> "So here's some advice for those in D.C. who want to shine in the greatest show on earth. Too often when big government and big business get together and cronyism sets in, well, it benefits insiders not everyday Americans."

### Overall Comments
There are clear populist elements in the speech. Firstly, it is possible to identify an appeal to a virtuous people represented by average Americans, workers, and the states. Secondly, a clear recognition of an elite is present, represented by the federal government and big businesses, which benefit at the expense of the people's interests. Finally, there is an acknowledgment of the general will of the people as the ultimate source of political power, which will enable change and restore governance to the people. Overall, Palin references ordinary people and their role in guiding politics and frequently references hard-working, ordinary Alaskans oppressed by big government, which she identifies as the elite in her speech. At this Tea Party rally, Palin's speech reflects small-government conservatism, where big government is the enemy. Her speech has a right-wing populist appeal but is not as strongly populist as Morales, who used more charged language like 'death cult of capitalism' and called for overthrowing the system. Palin's language is moderate by comparison. However, while she references historical figures like Ronald Reagan, this is standard for American conservatives. Her speech includes populist themes but also touches on specific policies like taxes and economic issues, which are less Manichaean. Palin's speech might score around 1.5, or slightly higher, but it doesn't qualify as a two. The elements are there and consistently used, but it's more moderate.

### Grade
Score: 1.5
