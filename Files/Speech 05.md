Remarks by the President in State of the Union Address

U.S. Capitol

9:11 P.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT: Madam Speaker, Vice President Biden, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans:

Our Constitution declares that from time to time, the President shall give to Congress information about the state of our union. For 220 years, our leaders have fulfilled this duty. They've done so during periods of prosperity and tranquility. And they've done so in the midst of war and depression; at moments of great strife and great struggle.

It's tempting to look back on these moments and assume that our progress was inevitable --- that America was always destined to succeed. But when the Union was turned back at Bull Run, and the Allies first landed at Omaha Beach, victory was very much in doubt. When the market crashed on Black Tuesday, and civil rights marchers were beaten on Bloody Sunday, the future was anything but certain. These were the times that tested the courage of our convictions, and the strength of our union. And despite all our divisions and disagreements, our hesitations and our fears, America prevailed because we chose to move forward as one nation, as one people.

Again, we are tested. And again, we must answer history's call.

One year ago, I took office amid two wars, an economy rocked by a severe recession, a financial system on the verge of collapse, and a government deeply in debt. Experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act, we might face a second depression. So we acted --- immediately and aggressively. And one year later, the worst of the storm has passed.

But the devastation remains. One in 10 Americans still cannot find work. Many businesses have shuttered. Home values have declined. Small towns and rural communities have been hit especially hard. And for those who'd already known poverty, life has become that much harder.

This recession has also compounded the burdens that America's families have been dealing with for decades --- the burden of working harder and longer for less; of being unable to save enough to retire or help kids with college.

So I know the anxieties that are out there right now. They're not new. These struggles are the reason I ran for President. These struggles are what I've witnessed for years in places like Elkhart, Indiana; Galesburg, Illinois. I hear about them in the letters that I read each night. The toughest to read are those written by children --- asking why they have to move from their home, asking when their mom or dad will be able to go back to work.

For these Americans and so many others, change has not come fast enough. Some are frustrated; some are angry. They don't understand why it seems like bad behavior on Wall Street is rewarded, but hard work on Main Street isn't; or why Washington has been unable or unwilling to solve any of our problems. They're tired of the partisanship and the shouting and the pettiness. They know we can't afford it. Not now.

So we face big and difficult challenges. And what the American people hope --- what they deserve --- is for all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to work through our differences; to overcome the numbing weight of our politics. For while the people who sent us here have different backgrounds, different stories, different beliefs, the anxieties they face are the same. The aspirations they hold are shared: a job that pays the bills; a chance to get ahead; most of all, the ability to give their children a better life.

You know what else they share? They share a stubborn resilience in the face of adversity. After one of the most difficult years in our history, they remain busy building cars and teaching kids, starting businesses and going back to school. They're coaching Little League and helping their neighbors. One woman wrote to me and said, 'We are strained but hopeful, struggling but encouraged.'

It's because of this spirit --- this great decency and great strength --- that I have never been more hopeful about America's future than I am tonight. (Applause.) Despite our hardships, our union is strong. We do not give up. We do not quit. We do not allow fear or division to break our spirit. In this new decade, it's time the American people get a government that matches their decency; that embodies their strength. (Applause.) And tonight, tonight I'd like to talk about how together we can deliver on that promise.

It's because of this spirit --- this great decency and great strength --- that I have never been more hopeful about America's future than I am tonight. (Applause.) Despite our hardships, our union is strong. We do not give up. We do not quit. We do not allow fear or division to break our spirit. In this new decade, it's time the American people get a government that matches their decency; that embodies their strength. (Applause.) And tonight, tonight I'd like to talk about how together we can deliver on that promise.

The spirit that has sustained this nation for more than two centuries lives on in you, its people. We have finished a difficult year. We have come through a difficult decade. But a new year has come. A new decade stretches before us. We don't quit. I don't quit. (Applause.) Let's seize this moment -- to start anew, to carry the dream forward, and to strengthen our union once more. (Applause.)

Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)

## Coded Analysis

### Thought Process
Obama's speech includes a modest pro-people element, but it is firmly rooted in pluralist and pragmatic language. He frequently refers to the struggles of "hard-working Americans," families trying to make ends meet, and small business owners weathering the recession. He highlights stories from "Elkhart, Indiana," "Galesburg, Illinois," and even quotes letters from children and struggling parents. However, he does not construct "the people" as a unified, morally superior actor whose will must dominate politics. Instead, he emphasizes diversity: Americans have "different backgrounds, different stories, different beliefs." The moral tone is empathetic, but not sacralizing. The people are valued as the subjects and beneficiaries of public policy, not as the singular source of political legitimacy. Thus, while the speech draws emotional strength from its connection to ordinary Americans, it does not fulfill the populist criterion of a righteous, homogenous "people."

The anti-elite critique in the speech is present, but diffuse and non-essential. Obama takes clear aim at Wall Street behavior, criticizing banks that "hand out big bonuses" after being rescued by taxpayers, and CEOs who "reward themselves for failure." He also critiques lobbyists, special interests, and the recent Supreme Court decision that opened the door to greater corporate spending in elections. Yet, this elite is not framed as a singular, evil group intentionally subverting democracy. Obama explicitly notes that institutions like corporations, the media, and even government are "full of honorable men and women." His criticisms are functional, not moralistic; institutional, not conspiratorial. The elite is not cast as an existential threat to the people, but rather as a powerful actor whose actions must be checked and reformed within the bounds of democratic norms. This keeps the anti-elite element from crossing into populist territory.

The Manichaean dimension is largely absent. Obama does not present politics as a binary battle between good and evil, or the people versus a corrupt elite. Instead, he emphasizes cooperation, compromise, and shared responsibility. He frames America's history as one of resilience in the face of uncertainty, and repeatedly appeals to bipartisan collaboration. There are no apocalyptic warnings, no claims of betrayal or moral decay. Even his sharpest critiques are embedded in a framework of reform and renewal rather than confrontation. While he expresses urgency and frustration with the pace of change, he remains measured in tone and hopeful in outlook. This absence of cosmic or dualistic framing clearly distinguishes the speech from the high-stakes, polarized narratives common to populist discourse.

Finally, the speech is strongly pluralist, both in substance and rhetoric. Obama repeatedly affirms institutional integrity, democratic procedures, and the importance of working across partisan divides. He invokes a "deficit of trust," not to discredit institutions, but to argue for greater transparency and accountability through institutional reforms. His policy agenda—ranging from health care and education to tax reform and infrastructure—is pragmatic and technocratic. He supports oversight mechanisms, bipartisan commissions, and legislation crafted through deliberation and compromise. There is no call to bypass or upend the rules of the game; rather, he seeks to make them work better. The speech exudes faith in the capacity of democratic institutions to respond to crises and enact meaningful change—hallmarks of pluralist political discourse.

The speech registers slightly above 0.0 on the populism scale—perhaps around 0.2—due to limited elite critique and rhetorical alignment with popular suffering. However, it remains fundamentally pluralist and pragmatic, eschewing populist structure and tone in favor of inclusive, institutional discourse.

### Pluralism

#### Rubric 1: Pluralist vision of the world
**Evidence**: 
> "We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well while a growing number of Americans barely get by, or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. (Applause.) What's at stake aren't Democratic values or Republican values, but American values. And we have to reclaim them."

**Coder Justification**: ""

#### Rubric 2: Concrete interpretation of political issues
**Evidence**: 
> "In 2008, the house of cards collapsed. We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who couldn't afford or understand them. Banks had made huge bets and bonuses with other people's money. Regulators had looked the other way, or didn't have the authority to stop the bad behavior."
> "It was wrong. It was irresponsible. And it plunged our economy into a crisis that put millions out of work, saddled us with more debt, and left innocent, hardworking Americans holding the bag. In the six months before I took office, we lost nearly 4 million jobs. And we lost another 4 million before our policies were in full effect."
> "Those are the facts. But so are these: In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than 3 million jobs."

**Coder Justification**: ""

#### Rubric 3: Democracy as calculation of votes of individual citizens
**Evidence**: 
> "Let's also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented, hardworking students in this country face another challenge: the fact that they aren't yet American citizens. Many were brought here as small children, are American through and through, yet they live every day with the threat of deportation."

**Coder Justification**: ""

#### Rubric 4: Non-antagonistic view of opponents
**Evidence**: 
> "Some of this has to do with the corrosive influence of money in politics. So together, let's take some steps to fix that. Send me a bill that bans insider trading by members of Congress; I will sign it tomorrow."

**Coder Justification**: ""

#### Rubric 5: Incremental reform
**Evidence**: 
> "Tonight, I'm announcing the creation of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will be charged with investigating unfair trading practices in countries like China. (Applause.) There will be more inspections to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders."
> "Join me in a national commitment to train 2 million Americans with skills that will lead directly to a job."

**Coder Justification**: ""

#### Rubric 6: Commitment to institutional norms, rights and liberties
**Evidence**: 
> "Let's never forget: Millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a government and a financial system that do the same. It's time to apply the same rules from top to bottom. No bailouts, no handouts, and no copouts. An America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody."

### Overall Comments
In Barack Obama's speech, it is marked by non-populist element focusing in pragmatic and pluralistic features. Firstly, although there is an appeal to the American people, they are not understood as an inherently virtuous entity. Secondly, even though there is a reference to Wall Street and those at the top, the speech does not exclude an elite or an evil minority as the sole cause of society's and the people's problems. Finally, there is a reference to the general will of the people, but not as the ultimate source of political power that prevails above all else. Additionally, Obama's speech is focused on specific topics, which are intended to be addressed through differentiated and concrete public policies. Furthermore, it demonstrates complete respect for institutions and the rules of the game, as well as the absence of combative language. This aligns it more closely with a pragmatic or pluralistic discourse. However, there is a criticism of Wall Street and big companies, which can be read as criticism of elites oppressing the American people and profiting while regular workers suffer the financial crisis. There's mention of ordinary, hard-working Americans who are enduring the effects of this crisis, while companies continue to profit. These slight populist themes prevent it from being a 0.0. However, it doesn't include the 'general will' of the people or depict a unified, homogenous group, which are necessary elements for a speech to be considered populist with at least a category of one.
