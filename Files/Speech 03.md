# Training Speech Morales

## Full Text
*This is the text of a speech given in 2003 shortly after the events mentioned in the speech.*

What happened these past days in Bolivia was a great revolt by those who have been oppressed for more than 500 years. The will of the people was imposed this September and October, and has begun to overcome the empire's cannons. We have lived for so many years through the confrontation of two cultures: the culture of life represented by the indigenous people, and the culture of death represented by the West. When we the indigenous people--together with the workers and even the businessmen of our country--fight for life and justice, the State responds with its 'democratic rule of law.'

What does the 'rule of law' mean for indigenous people? For the poor, the marginalized, the excluded, the 'rule of law' means the targeted assassinations and collective massacres that we have endured. Not just this September and October, but for many years, in which they have tried to impose policies of hunger and poverty on the Bolivian people. Above all, the 'rule of law' means the accusations that we, the Quechuas, Aymaras and Guaranties of Bolivia keep hearing from our governments: that we are narcos, that we are anarchists. This uprising of the Bolivian people has been not only about gas and hydrocarbons, but an intersection of many issues: discrimination, marginalization, and most importantly, the failure of neoliberalism.

The cause of all these acts of bloodshed, and for the uprising of the Bolivian people, has a name: neoliberalism. With courage and defiance, we brought down Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada--the symbol of neoliberalism in our country--on October 17, the Bolivians' day of dignity and identity. We began to bring down the symbol of corruption and the political mafia.

And I want to tell you, companeras and companeros, how we have built the consciousness of the Bolivian people from the bottom up. How quickly the Bolivian people have reacted, have said--as Subcomandate Marcos says--ya basta!, enough policies of hunger and misery.

For us, October 17th is the beginning of a new phase of construction. Most importantly, we face the task of ending selfishness and individualism, and creating--from the rural campesino and indigenous communities to the urban slums--other forms of living, based on solidarity and mutual aid. We must think about how to redistribute the wealth that is concentrated among few hands. This is the great task we Bolivian people face after this great uprising.

It has been very important to organize and mobilize ourselves in a way based on transparency, honesty, and control over our own organizations. And it has been important not only to organize but also to unite. Here we are now, united intellectuals in defense of humanity--I think we must have not only unity among the social movements, but also that we must coordinate with the intellectual movements. Every gathering, every event of this nature for we labor leaders who come from the social struggle, is a great lesson that allows us to exchange experiences and to keep strengthening our people and our grassroots organizations.

Thus, in Bolivia, our social movements, our intellectuals, our workers--even those political parties which support the popular struggle joined together to drive out Gonzalo Sánchez Lozada. Sadly, we paid the price with many of our lives, because the empire's arrogance and tyranny continue humiliating the Bolivian people.

It must be said, compañeras and compañeros, that we must serve the social and popular movements rather than the transnational corporations. I am new to politics; I had hated it and had been afraid of becoming a career politician. But I realized that politics had once been the science of serving the people, and that getting involved in politics is important if you want to help your people. By getting involved, I mean living for politics, rather than living off of politics. We have coordinated our struggles between the social movements and political parties, with the support of our academic institutions, in a way that has created a greater national consciousness. That is what made it possible for the people to rise up in these recent days.

When we speak of the 'defense of humanity,' as we do at this event, I think that this only happens by eliminating neoliberalism and imperialism. But I think that in this we are not so alone, because we see, every day that anti-imperialist thinking is spreading, especially after Bush's bloody 'intervention' policy in Iraq. Our way of organizing and uniting against the system, against the empire's aggression towards our people, is spreading, as are the strategies for creating and strengthening the power of the people.

I believe only in the power of the people. That was my experience in my own region, a single province--the importance of local power. And now, with all that has happened in Bolivia, I have seen the importance of the power of a whole people, of a whole nation. For those of us who believe it important to defend humanity, the best contribution we can make is to help create that popular power. This happens when we check our personal interests with those of the group. Sometimes, we commit to the social movements in order to win power. We need to be led by the people, not use or manipulate them.

We may have differences among our popular leaders--and it's true that we have them in Bolivia. But when the people are conscious, when the people know what needs to be done, any difference among the different local leaders ends. We've been making progress in this for a long time, so that our people are finally able to rise up, together.

What I want to tell you, compañeras and compañeros--what I dream of and what we as leaders from Bolivia dream of is that our task at this moment should be to strengthen anti-imperialist thinking. Some leaders are now talking about how we--the intellectuals, the social and political movements--can organize a great summit of people like Fidel, Chávez. and Lula to say to everyone: 'We are here, taking a stand against the aggression of the US imperialism.'

A summit at which we are joined by compañera Rigoberta Menchú, by other social and labor leaders, great personalities like Pérez Ezquivel. A great summit to say to our people that we are together, united, and defending humanity. We have no other choice, compañeros and compañeras--if we want to defend humanity we must change systems and this means overthrowing US imperialism.

## Coded Analysis

### Thought Process
Evo Morales's speech is grounded in a strong pro-people narrative, which clearly defines who "the people" are: Bolivia's indigenous communities (Quechuas, Aymaras, Guaraníes), campesinos, workers, and poor urban dwellers. Morales frames these groups as morally virtuous and historically oppressed, describing them as having "been oppressed for more than 500 years." He valorizes their resistance and collective awakening: "the will of the people was imposed this September and October," and celebrates this moment as a kind of resurrection of dignity and popular power. His calls for "other forms of living, based on solidarity and mutual aid" reflect a romanticized and moral conception of the people as not only sovereign but ethically superior. He speaks of "popular power" as a political ideal and calls for leaders who "live for politics, rather than live off politics," reinforcing the idea that legitimacy flows from fidelity to the people's will. In short, Morales's speech constructs "the people" as a singular, righteous, and unified moral force.

The speech also includes a vivid and expansive construction of an evil elite, which Morales portrays as conspiratorial, violent, and systemically oppressive. This elite includes the Bolivian political class (especially former president Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada), transnational corporations, neoliberal policymakers, and U.S. imperialism. Morales blames this elite for "targeted assassinations and collective massacres," as well as for long-term structural violence: "policies of hunger and poverty," and the cultural demonization of indigenous people, whom the state accuses of being "narcos" and "anarchists." The term "political mafia" suggests a corrupt and self-serving political class, and Morales denounces neoliberalism itself as "the cause of all these acts of bloodshed." He explicitly identifies U.S. foreign policy, including George W. Bush's intervention in Iraq, as an extension of the same imperialist aggression facing Bolivia. This enemy is described not merely in political or economic terms, but in moral and existential ones, and is depicted as incompatible with the values and survival of the people.

The speech is deeply steeped in a Manichaean worldview, portraying the political field as a struggle between life and death, virtue and evil, dignity and humiliation. Morales contrasts "the culture of life represented by the indigenous people" with "the culture of death represented by the West." This dualism saturates the rhetoric, as he depicts neoliberalism and imperialism as antithetical to humanity itself. The uprising is not just a political event—it is framed as a battle for the soul of Bolivia, if not humanity: "if we want to defend humanity we must change systems and this means overthrowing US imperialism." There are no shades of gray in this cosmology—only an oppressed people rising against a predatory and inhumane system. The invocation of October 17 as "the Bolivians' day of dignity and identity" marks it as a foundational and morally charged event, cementing the sense of cosmic stakes and finality typical of populist discourse.

There are no meaningful pluralist elements in Morales's speech. He does not acknowledge a legitimate diversity of interests, nor does he affirm democratic institutions as neutral arenas for negotiation among competing groups. Instead, existing political institutions—especially the rule of law—are depicted as masks for violence and domination: "the 'rule of law' means the targeted assassinations and collective massacres that we have endured." Political opponents are not framed as misguided but legitimate actors; rather, they are enemies of the people who must be removed or overthrown. Even when Morales mentions political parties and intellectuals joining with social movements, this is not framed as coalition-building among equals, but as a unification behind the moral cause of the people. The emphasis on "unity" is not pluralist—it is homogenizing and moralizing. There is no suggestion that dissent, institutional balance, or compromise are values to be preserved. Instead, this is a radically populist vision that positions politics as the vehicle for restoring the sacred will of the people and expelling the forces of imperialism and neoliberalism.

Based on this, I would say that this is a 1.9 on a scale of 0.0 to 2.0. These populist elements are all there, but the Manichean part could have been a little bit stronger, but not much more.

### Overall Comments
Firstly, the speech strongly identifies the notion of the Bolivian people or the Indigenous people in opposition to North American imperialism and neoliberalism. Additionally, at a national scale, there is an antagonistic notion against the traditional political elites in Bolivia, the State and the 'rule of law', positioned against the Indigenous peoples, workers, and the poor. Here, the people are strongly defined as the marginalized and the excluded, including various Indigenous peoples and workers. I would say that the pro-people component is clearly present in this speech, and are seen as the means to overcome the corrupt system and bring prosperity to the country.

Similarly, because the poor and indigenous are juxtaposed against a corrupt political elite and North American neoliberals, I would also say that the element of anti-elite rhetoric is also there, as the speech rails against these groups as being undemocratic and undermining the will of the previously identified 'pure' people.

Additionally, the Manichean element is present. There is the use of combative language opposing imperialism, with terms such as the 'culture of death' or the 'bloody' war in Iraq, which indicates cosmic proportions, while the talk of the will of the people overthrowing the old system and neoliberalism is a call for radical change. There are no clear non-populist elements in the discourse.

This is a very populist speech. One could argue for a two, since the speech basically meet the ideals for each component of populism. However, I would argue that for as much as the speech demonizes the elite and uses cosmic proportions, a two warrants slightly more intense rhetoric on both of these fronts. The score should be slightly less than a two.
